# Functions With Global Variables

### Setup

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Run `npm install` to install the testing library.
3. Preferably in a full-screen terminal, run `npm test` to start testing.


### Workflow

You'll be working in **`main.test.js`** this time!, creating the variables needed with the values asked for, according to the specifications given in the tests. Check your terminal for feedback on which aspect of the problem you have yet to complete, and read the specifications' actual code implementation for extra help; it makes explicit exactly what outputs are expected given the test inputs.


### Guidelines:

* This time, **declare your variables using `let`**!
* Please do **not** call the functions; just declare them! You can call them to check for your own testing purposes, but then either delete or comment out the line.
* If you are asked to define a variable in terms of another, do not recalculate the value of that variable. For example, if x = 5, and y = 6, and z is supposed to be x + y, do NOT set y to equal 11 directly. Use the variables instead.


### Tasks

Let's start by creating our variables (using `let` this time, but we'll move back to `const` soon enough!) so that we can manipulate them later on with functions. 

* Create a variable named `x` and assign to it the value 3.
* Create a variable named `y` and assign to it the value 10.
* Create a variable called `squareTheNumber` and assign to it the value of 4.
* Create a variable called  `greeting` and  assign to it the string 'hello'.
* Create a variable called  `firstName` and assign to it the string of your name.
* Create a variable called  `calling` and assign to it the string 'ringing'.



Now let's make these variables useful!

* Create a function named  `double` and have it double the value of x.
* Create a function named  `triple` and have it triple the value of y.
* Create a function named  `square` and have it square the value of squareTheNumber.
* Create a function named  `beingNice` and have it change the value of greeting to the string 'hello' plus your name using the value of the variable `firstName`. You can include other characters if you wish.
* Create a function named  `fullName` and have it change the value of firstName to the string 'not found'.
* Create a function named  `phoneCall` and have it change the value of calling to the string 'call ended'.
